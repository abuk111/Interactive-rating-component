## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my first challenge with Javascript. The trickiest part of it was set the "focus state" for selected rating - I have problem how to operate with nodelist. After all, forEach() method helps!

### Continued development

I find this project is finished
